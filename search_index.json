Basics Workshop and Testing\nLearning New Programming Languages First Workshop on Golang\nRead the Golang GitBook\nInstall Go\nGO\nGOPATH\n\nDefine GOPATH\nUsing environment variables set GOPATH=/Users/marcelbelmont/go\nThis is an example of MAC OS X\nWindows users might have to edit the environment variables through advanced settings\nAlthough the MSI installer should do this\n\n\n\nWorkspace\nA workspace is a directory hierarchy with three directories at its root:\n\nsrc contains Go source files\npkg contains package objects\nbin contains executable commands\n\nThe GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace.\n\nIt defaults to a directory named go inside your home directory, so $HOME/go on Unix\n%USERPROFILE%\\go (usually C:\\Users\\YourName\\go) on Windows.\n\nCreate your projects under the workspace\n\nMy path is /Users/marcelbelmont/go and I place all my projects under\n\n /Users/marcelbelmont/go/src/github.com/jbelmont \nThis is a convention followed in GO to make your project go get able\nMAC users should run the following command mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/${github-username} in terminal\nOptionally just open finder and right click and folder structure manually\nWindows users can do the same thing\nEditor\nI would recommend the VSCODE Text Editor it has a nice Go extension\nDownload CODE\nInstall Go extension by clicking extension icon and type go in the market place input box then install it\n\nThe extension will prompt you to install some missing packages you should do this \nLint, Formatting, and more will be done by the EDITOR\n\nWorkshop Koans\nI have created a set of practice koans for everyone to do\nKoans are basically tests that are failing that you need to get passing\n\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/${name}\nRun git clone https://github.com/jbelmont/golang-workshop.git in order to install the repository\nRun go test in order to see the first failing koan\nYou should see filename and line number where the koan is failing. Try to make it pass\n\nPractice\nInside the practice folder are a couple of exercises for you to try if you have time remaining\nDocumentation\nI have added documentation for you to read at your leisure with different GO topics in the GITBOOK\n"},"docs/lessons/variables.html":{"url":"docs/lessons/variables.html","title":"Variables","keywords":"","body":"Variables\nVariables Go Specification\nVariables in Go can be declared and initialized in several different ways.\nDeclare variable with var keyword\nvar pizza string\npizza = \"pizza\"\n\nAlternatively you can write the statement like this\nvar pizza string = \"pizza\"\n\nNotice that we didn't specify a type of string it was inferred\nInside functions, loops, and control flow statements you can use a shorthand operator\nfunc printName(name string) string {\n    modName := name + \"is a person\"\n    return modName\n}\n\nYou cannot use the shorthand operator := outside of this context\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\nstr := \"Hello, playground\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(str)\n}\n\nIf you were to try to run this hello world program you would see the following error message\nsyntax error: non-declaration statement outside function body\nNaming variables\n\nNames must start with a letter and may contain letters, numbers or the _ (underscore) symbol\n\nDefault values\nVariables are given default values when they are declared\nvar num int // 0\n\nvar dec float64 // 0\n\nvar str string // \"\"\n\nvar isVal bool // false\n\nvar num2 *int // nil\n\ntype Data struct{} // nil\n\nfunc someFunc() {} // nil\n\nVariables Playground\n"},"docs/lessons/conditionals.html":{"url":"docs/lessons/conditionals.html","title":"Conditionals","keywords":"","body":"Conditionals\nIf Go Specification\nGolang has control structures as you may have seen them in other programming languages\nYou just won't see parenthesis () around them\nvalue2 := 7\nif value2 > 10 {\n    value2++\n}\n\nThere exists if, else if, else, switch but there is not a ternary operator ?:\nconst movie = \"Rocky\"\nvar score int\nif movie == \"Rambo\" {\n    score = 9\n} else if movie == \"Rocky\" {\n    score = 10\n} else {\n    score = 6\n}\n\nTraditionally with a ternary operator you could do the following in one line\nnum := 3\nisFlag := num == 3 ? \"I am 3\" : \"Nope\"\n\nYou can do the above statement as follows\nvar str string\nif num == 3 {\n    str = \"I am 3\"\n} else {\n    str = \"Nope\"\n}\n\nThere are some nice features to the if statement\nif ok := strings.Contains(val, \"foo\");

through:\nexported functions that preserve internal invariants\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nA package declaration is required at the start of every Go source file.\nIts main purpose is to determine the default identifier for that package called the package name when\nit is imported by another package.\n\n\nA Go source file may contain zero or more import declarations immediately after the package\ndeclaration and before the first non-import declaration.\n\n\nEach import declaration may specify the import path of a single package\nor multiple packages in a parenthesized list\n\nimport \"fmt\"\nimport \"os\"\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\nNotice above the 2 different styles and both are valid, albeit the latter is more concise\nimport (\n    \"encoding/json\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"net/http\"\n\n    \"github.com/Code-Craftsmanship-Saturdays/software-security/model\"\n)\n\n\nYou can also group packages by adding blank lines.\nThe first group is part of the standard library and last group is part of a package I wrote\nThese packages must be used are there will be unused import error\n\nimport _ \"image/png\" // register PNG decoder this is known as a blank import and it doesn't have to be used in the package\n\nAny function, types, etc that you capitalize will be made Public outside of the package\notherwise they are private\n\n\n\n"},"docs/lessons/testing.html":{"url":"docs/lessons/testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Testing\n\nGo has a lightweight test framework composed of the go test command and the testing package.\nWrite a test by creating a file with a name ending in _test.go\nWrite functions named TestXXX with signature func (t *testing.T)\n\n\nThe test framework runs each such function\nif the function calls a failure function such as t.Error or t.Fail, the test is considered to have failed.\n\n\n\nfunc TestAverage(t *testing.T) {\n    numbers := []float64{\n        1, 2,

TestAverage notice that it takes the signature func (t *testing.T)\nMake sure to append _test.go to the end of the test so that go finds the test.\nIn Go you assert what should not occur which is a break from the xunit style of assert.equal \n"},"docs/lessons/practice.html":{"url":"docs/lessons/practice.html","title":"Practice","keywords":"","body":"Practice\n\nCreate a folder called
